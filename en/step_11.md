## What next?

-   You could make some changes to the code to give animated weather icons. Have a look at the [documentation](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to see how to make animations for the micro:bit.
-   You could use [Touch Develop](https://www.touchdevelop.com/microbit) to write your micro:bit code. This uses the Bluetooth functionality to communicate with a computer and receive weather data, giving you a portable meteorologist.
