## What you will make
In this resource, you'll turn your micro:bit into a meteorologist that can display the weather forecast for the next seven days, for wherever you live.

## What you will learn
By creating a micro:bit meteorologist, you will learn:

- How to start two-way communication between your micro:bit and your Raspberry Pi
- How to fetch a weather forecast using PyOWM
- How to create custom images to display on the micro:bit

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Apply abstraction and decomposition to solve more complex problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/developer)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
